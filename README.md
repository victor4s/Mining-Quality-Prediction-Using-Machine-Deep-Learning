This is a free guided project from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/projects/mining-quality-prediction), in which machine learning and deep learning models will be used to predict the % of Silica Concentrate in the Iron ore concentrate per minute for a mining company, such methods are being used more and more as they are carried out more quickly than traditional methods. In this hands-on project we will go through the following tasks: (1) Understand the Problem Statement, (2) Import libraries and datasets, (3) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis, (4) Perform Data Visualization, (5) Create Training and Testing Datasets, (6) Train and Evaluate a Gradient Boosting Regressor Model, (7) Train and Evaluate a Decision Tree Regressor Model,(8) Train and Evaluate a Random Forest Regressor Model, (9) Train and Evaluate an Artificial Neural Network Model, (10) Calculate and Print Regression model KPIs.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Python libraries to import and visualize dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Understand the distribution and relationship of data
- Split and Standardize training and testing dataset
- Train and evaluate Linear Regression Model
- Train and evaluate a Random Forest Model
- Train and evaluate Artificial Neural Networks to perform regression tasks
- Evaluate, compare and analyze the performance of different regression models
- Understand the difference between various regression models KPIs such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2, adjusted R2
